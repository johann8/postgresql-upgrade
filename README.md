<h1 align="center">Docker - PostgreSQL DB upgrade</h1>

# postgresql-upgrade

## About

Upgrade PostgreSQL database into another database using a simple `docker run`

## Overview

It uses `pg_upgrade` binary from PostgreSQL docker image to upgrade.

It should work for any database version compliant with `pg_uprgade`

:+1: Tested from 9.3+ to [10-14] and more

:warning: `pg_upgrade` is not able to downgrade

## Requirements

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install)

## Usage

This Docker image runs `pg_upgrade` as a default command.

Default command (CMD) can be overridden using `psql` or `bash` or any command
available in official PostgreSQL docker image. In this case new database is
initialized but `pg_upgrade` is not executed. (See troubleshooting section)

Either way, the command is run with postgres system user.

After successful upgrade, new database is available in the target folder.
In any case source database is not modified.

PostgreSQL version, database encoding and locale are discovered from
source database.

:warning: Be sure to set PGUSER variable with an existing superuser in source
database

Docker volumes for source and target are required.
The source (old) folder should contain database to migrate. (See example below)

Variables:

* PGUSER (default postgres)
* POSTGRES_NEW (default 14)
* DB_INIT (default true)

### Example

Let's say our source database is located in "/data/pg-old" and the target one
built in "/data/pg-new". Upgrade to PostgreSQL v13 with "postgres" as
a superuser.

```bash
docker run -t -i \
  -e POSTGRES_NEW=17 \
  -e PGUSER=postgres \
  -v /data/pg-old:/pg_old/data \
  -v /data/pg-new:/pg_new/data \
  johann8/postgresql-upgrade
```

`:/pg_old/data` ad `:/pg_new/data` should not be modified.

## Build

Build your own image:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johann8/postgresql-upgrade.git
cd postgresql-upgrade
docker build -t my-postgresql-upgrade .
```

Then use it:

```bash
docker run -t -i \
  -e POSTGRES_NEW=17 \
  -e PGUSER=postgres \
  -v /data/pg-old:/pg_old/data \
  -v /data/pg-new:/pg_new/data \
  my-postgresql-upgrade
```

## Troubleshooting

Would like to use `bash` to debug? In this case target database is prepared but
`pg_upgrade` is not ran.

```bash
docker run -t -i \
  -e POSTGRES_NEW=17 \
  -e PGUSER=postgres \
  -v /data/pg-old:/pg_old/data \
  -v /data/pg-new:/pg_new/data \
  johann8/postgresql-upgrade \
  /bin/bash
```

Enjoy !
